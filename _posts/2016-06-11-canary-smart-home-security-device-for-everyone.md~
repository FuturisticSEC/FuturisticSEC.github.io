What are the odds that your home will be burglarized this year? Data from the FBI 2012 crime report shows that we can expect one in every thirty-six homes to be burglarized this year, resulting in an average loss of $2,230 per break in (totaling $4.7 billion in property losses). These numbers do not account for any additional psychological costs to the homeowners, as burglary victims may subsequently live in fear and harbor feelings of personal violation.


That was back in 2012, by now we should be expecting more danger from burglars, because i was asking myself that same question, things are not as tough as their are now, we leave our house most times going to our work, meanwhile traveling away from home doesn't really stop one from not knowing what's happening at home.
