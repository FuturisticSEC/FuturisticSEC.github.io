What are the odds that your home will not be burglarized this year?, Data from the FBI 2012 crime report shows that we can expect one in every thirty-six homes to be burglarized, resulting in an average loss of $2,230 per break in (totaling $4.7 billion in property losses). These numbers do not account for any additional psychological costs to the homeowners, as burglary victims may subsequently live in fear and harbor feelings of personal violation.

That was back in 2012, by now we should be expecting more danger from burglars, we leave our home most times going to our work, and  traveling away from home doesn't really stop one from not knowing what's happening at home.

60% of burglaries occur in the daytime when the residents are away.

Canary is a single device that contains an HD video camera and multiple sensors that track everything from motion, temperature and air quality to vibration, sound, and activity to help keep you, your family and your home safe.

Controlled entirely from your iPhone or Android device, Canary alerts you when it senses anything out of the ordinary — from sudden temperature changes that can indicate a fire, to the sound and movement that could mean an intrusion. Instantly receive, view and act on the alerts wherever you are. Over time, Canary learns your home’s rhythms to send you smarter alerts. Canary is the smartest way to stay secure.

Being away from home doesn’t mean you can’t respond to emergencies. Canary alerts you immediately when it senses something is off.

Once you receive an alert, you decide how to respond. Do you want to text your neighbor to check in? Call the police? You have the ability to decide.
