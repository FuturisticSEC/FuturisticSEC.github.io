While growing up i remember back then in Primary School, we had Computer Systems, and those system was part of our learning activities, but to my surprise we were only brought into the Computer Room one sunny afternoon and few minutes later the teacher was done with us, imagine what she taught us, nothing. If i can remember vividly, we didn't even touch the Computer System, neither keyboard or mouse, she only showed us the Desktop Computers, that was all, from then till when we left for our primary 6 exams. i remember that day, like it was today, i wasn't happy, because i have already envisioned myself sitting in front of the Desktop Computer already.

But today Computer had come to stay, and there is an unreasonable amount of things one can achieve with just an ordinary Computer, a lot of economy are becoming Computer dependent, infact if an economy had not integrated Digital Computer into her system, then that economy is likely to still suffer, e.g Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin and lots of third world country. 

Due to personal experience and fear of not wanting any child to be denied what he/she is entitled too, a lot of the Computers in our Nursery and Primary Schools are sitting idle with dust covering most part of it, please start dusting it, if you don't have a computer and have a school, or can support a school, please try and get for our future leaders, we don't want our future leaders of tomorrow to grow up, and still not be a computer literate, when they can start learning something now. So therefore we at Futuristic Security had to team up with our colleague at  Schoolsplay.org and the other owners and hard-working creator of the other seven open-source application, we used to bring to you the ChildsPlay and Friends Project.
