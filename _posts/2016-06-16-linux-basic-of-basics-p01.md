Good Day Pal, today we'll be discussing about linux as an operating system with many benefits that come with it. There's a lot of tutorials online as regard to how you can use Linux, but i'll be bringing you a cheat-sheet of the most essential commands on linux. [read more on Linux through wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).

Here in Nigeria, the name *Linux* still sound strange to a lot of people out there, majority of people with a computer have windows pre-installed with it, i use to like windows but since i came across *Linux* some years back, i have dump windows as my most prefered Operating System, meanwhile i have been doing everything on Linux with Linux.

Am not asking you to dump windows, but am asking about giving Linux a try, [here's a list of different Linux flavors with details](http://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso). You can do alot with Linux, but first you should also know that you can install Linux along side your default OS(windows), i am using Ubuntu Linux, you can search more on the flavors that suite your taste. Linux is Opensource, meaning it is free. All you have to do after installation is apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade to get your OS to the latest version.
